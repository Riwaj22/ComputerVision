# ComputerVision

Computer Vision (CV) is a field of study that focuses on enabling computers to understand and interpret visual information from images or videos. OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a widely used open-source library that provides various tools, functions, and algorithms for computer vision tasks. It is written in C++ and has bindings for several programming languages, including Python.

Some Features are:
Image and Video Input/Output: OpenCV allows reading and writing images and videos.<br>

Image Processing: Provides functions for various image processing tasks.<br>

Feature Detection and Description: Algorithms for detecting and describing image features.<br>

Object Detection and Tracking: Algorithms for detecting and tracking objects.<br>

Facial Analysis: Tools for facial detection, recognition, and analysis.<br>

Machine Learning Integration: Integration with popular machine learning frameworks.<br>

Camera Calibration and 3D Reconstruction: Tools for camera calibration and 3D reconstruction.<br>

GUI and Visualization: Functions for creating GUI, handling user inputs, and visualizing results.<br>
